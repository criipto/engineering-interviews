# Node.js engineering candidates

Implement your own test runner!

We've provided a typescript interface in `src/test_runner.ts` and an example test file in `example.test.ts`.

The test can be run with `npm run start`.

Expected output is something like (format is not super important):

```
✅ synchronous suite > passes
❌ synchronous suite > fails
✅ asynchronous suite > passes
❌ asynchronous suite > fails
```
